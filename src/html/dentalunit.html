            <h3>Dental Emergency</h3>
            <p>
                Do you find yourself in pain due to your tooth? Did you experience a chipped or broken tooth? Did you suffer from gum irritation or lost a crown? If so,
                do not worry! At Health Care we are able to provide emergency treatment to alleviate and manage these issues.
                Quick and effective treatment can sometimes save a tooth that might otherwise have been lost as a result due dental tooth bleeding or infections.

            <p>
                Dental implants are the only dental restoration option that preserves natural bone, actually helping to stimulate bone growth.
                When performed by one of our experienced dental surgeons, dental implant surgery is one of the safest and most predictable procedures in dentistry.
                Should you feel that you need or have more inquiries about dental implants, it is recommended to consult our dental surgeons by booking an appointment to discuss and evaluate your dental requirements.

                        No - It certainly doesn't have to be. Our mouth is one of the few parts of the body that can be as healthy and
                        active as we are in adulthood. If you brush and floss daily, lead a healthy lifestyle and see your dentist regularly,
                        there is no reason not to enjoy a complete set of teeth until your retirement.

                        Yes. Adults are more likely to experience certain dental problems - e.g. Cracked teeth, decay or loss of gum lines - mainly due to aging of 
                        the teeth and other health conditions. These can be quite serious but they can be prevented. Be sure to see your dentist every 6 months and 
                        discuss problems with your dentist when you visit your next dental unit.

                        actually a link between many medical conditions, such as diabetes and oral health. It is important to see your dentist regularly and disclose any

                        Brushing with a soft brush, using fluoride toothpaste and regular flossing will be the solution.
